* Tips for pycharm IDE (from Tip of the Day)
  * Rename the variable name / identifier : rename the variable at any place by pressing "Shift+F6" afterward then variable names at every place will be changed to the new name.



## 1 Book choice

* Most of the content is my note to the "test driven web development using python" that is available at: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com

The reason choosing this book is to learn what is called "test driven development (TDD)". Although I didn't particularly enjoy doing so, it reminds me of its advantages when I faced with a bunch of code not doing what it supposed to do and I got no clue on why is that. There are, obviously, different opinion on the methodology, just like what people did to everything.  However, you could issue your own opinions here:

## 2 IDE choice


* My addional content here is to implement the book using pycharm, a python IDE that is available at: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

The reason choosing Pycharm is its integrity to django and other python framework and easy management of python packages. Pycharm uses the prize awarded core as its IDE core, which is called "intelliJ"", combined with a simple package management system. You could easily create different environments (python interpreter version, package version etc) for different projects and use different version control system (VCS) and deployment tools to help you to develop and distribute your product.



Of course, there are also other excellent IDEs out there, like spider, or using python extentions to Vistual Stuido.Net and other integrate solutions like Anaconda,  python(x,y) and Winpython. You could pick up any one of them to get started.



Starting from the next passage, I basically follow the book's chapters and take my note on tips and traps. Hopefully it will be useful!
