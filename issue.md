# Issue
The issue prompt requires you to repond to a simple statement, by developing a position, and supporting it with convicing examples. To be able to do so you will have to keep the following points in mind.

## Keep it organized
Nothing reflects strong essay writing skills like orgnaization.
It Should be bundled into essay form: intro, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.

The intro serves to introduce the topic and should not be un-necesarily long. Clearly define the thesis statement.

The body paragraphs should develop your thesis.

The conclusion should recap what you've said (don't try to add any new information)

## Keep it focused
Within the paragraph it is easy for us to lose our way. Like:
summarized needlessly,
forgetting that the essay requires our analysis of an issue
Maybe our sentence do not link together logically, and we find ourselves rambling.
we find ourselves juggling several hypothetical examples, never really making a compelling case.

## Keep it engaging
Repetitive sentence structure makes for repetitive reading. Vary up the way you wrrite -- don't be afaid to use colon or a dash, drop in a semi-colon, and vary up the syntax.

Noun followed by verb followed by a adjective implies that you are a hesitant wring.

## Keep it specific
Hypotheticals are fine, if ou can use them to convincingly back up your point. Dull and vague abstraction:
- some people
- mankind
- you 
compare, latter is more impactful:
- Oppenheimerâ€™s knowledge of nuclear fusion allowed him to create the most destructive weapon the world had ever known
- scientists can sometimes use knowledge to hurt us.


## Keep it on the topic
The most important thing is to keep your essay on the topic.


## Keep it practicing
