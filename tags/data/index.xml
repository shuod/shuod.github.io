      <description>There are some general steps in predictive modeling that should work for all kinds of problem. Aside from science like predicting molecular orbital energies, bandgaps or chemical reactivity, other fields, like risk management, economic growth, are also important and should share some general principles.
Here I trying to learn how risk management was done in its field.
Risk management is the process by which risks are identified, assessed, measured and managed.</description>

      <description>A new idea that we can bypass quantum chemistry calculation using the proper machine learning method is prevalent now. It will be exciting if we could have a second way to resolve objectives of material discovery quest rather than adopting Density functional theory (DFT) that is the principal method used now. Here I will primarily compare predictions from DFT and a popular machine learning method called the Random Forest (RF).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linearing regression is one of the fundamental techqiques to use when analyze the data. If you were using Python, you would have several options to do this, including numpy, scipy and sklearn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
